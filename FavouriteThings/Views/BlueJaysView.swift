Growing up in Kitchener-Waterloo, I spent a lot of time with family that lived in areas nearby. My Aunt Phyllis and Uncle Bert in particular introduced me to baseball – or more specificially – Blue Jays baseball!

Lloyd Moseby, Dave Stieb, George Bell, Ernie Whitt... these were the Blue Jays of my youth. The sound of Tom Cheek and Jerry Howarth calling a game on the radio was the background to many summer days.

More recently I lived in downtown Toronto during the Blue Jays big runs of 2015 and 2016. I was in the Rogers Centre for Jose Bautista's "bat flip" home run, which is a moment I will never forget.

I now have many fond memories of bringing my own daughter, Claire, to Blue Jays games as she grew up. Once the pandemic is over, I am looking forward to getting back out to ballgames with my friends and family.
