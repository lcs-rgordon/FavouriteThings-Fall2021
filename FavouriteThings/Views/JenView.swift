My spouse, Jen, is certainly not a "thing" but a member of my family whom I love and appreciate more than anything.

We complement each other well. For example, she is a master planner. I can do that if I have to, but tend to be better with doing things spontaneously. Jen reads maps well, I have a sense of direction. You get the idea. ðŸ˜„

This is a photo of Jen walking through Central Park in New York City when we visited in the fall of 2014. I like how the curve of archway she is walking under is echoed in the curve of the umbrella Jen is holding.
