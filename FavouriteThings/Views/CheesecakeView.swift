I am well known in my family for my love of cheesecake. Whenever we would eat out at a restaurant as I was growing up, if we stayed for dessert, the first thing I would look for on the menu is cheesecake.

First things first: "supermarket cheesecake" is not real cheesecake. Sorry, Sara Lee.

What makes a good cheesecake? First, the filling. It shouldn't taste like a block of cheese... but it should also not be light, like a cream pie. There is a happy medium.

Second, the crust. A cheesecake's crust should be thick, with a good amount of crumble and no small amount of brown sugar. Not too hard, but defintely not soggy.

Finally, I like to compare apples to apples. The classic "New York style" cheesecake is best. Variants like chocolate cheesecake are OK, but my own preference is to stick with the standard.
