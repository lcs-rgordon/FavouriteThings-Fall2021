Growing up in Kitchener-Waterloo, I spent a lot of time with family that lived in areas nearby. My Aunt Phyllis and Uncle Bert in particular introduced me to baseball ‚Äì or more specificially ‚Äì Blue Jays baseball!

Lloyd Moseby, Dave Stieb, George Bell, Ernie Whitt... these were the Blue Jays of my youth. The sound of Tom Cheek and Jerry Howarth calling a game on the radio was the background to many summer days.

I am well known in my family for my love of cheesecake. Whenever we would eat out at a restaurant as I was growing up, if we stayed for dessert, the first thing I would look for on the menu is cheesecake.

First things first: "supermarket cheesecake" is not real cheesecake. Sorry, Sara Lee.

What makes a good cheesecake? First, the filling. It shouldn't taste like a block of cheese... but it should also not be light, like a cream pie. There is a happy medium.

Second, the crust. A cheesecake's crust should be thick, with a good amount of crumble and no small amount of brown sugar. Not too hard, but defintely not soggy.

Finally, I like to compare apples to apples. The classic "New York style" cheesecake is best. Variants like chocolate cheesecake are OK, but my own preference is to stick with the standard.

My daughter, Claire, is now 12 years old and in grade 7.

This is a photo of her when she was 6 years old. It was taken the day after she learned to read independently. Here's the story of how that happened...

We had been camping, and as usual, I read to Claire before she went to sleep.

Since we were in the same tent, Claire saw that my spouse, Jen, and I stayed up and continued to read for a while. Claire wanted to as well, so we told her, if you want to stay up, you can, but you need to read your book on your own.

So, she did! This is one of my favourite memories of Claire. ü•∞

Jen is certainly not a "thing" but a member of my family whom I love and appreciate more than anything.

We complement each other well. For example, she is a master planner. I can do that if I have to, but tend to be better with doing things spontaneously. Jen reads maps well, I have a sense of direction. You get the idea. üòÑ

This is a photo of Jen walking through Central Park in New York City when we visited in the fall of 2014. I like how the curve of archway she is walking under is echoed in the curve of the umbrella Jen is holding.

What else is there to say here? Lasagna is obviously awesome. üç¥üòã

I am half-Italian, so I suppose this is where my love of lasagna comes from.

Good homemade lasagna must have the appropriate balance of meat, cheese, and vegetables. The cheese is important: no cheddar! Provolone, mozzarella, and ricotta only.

If you like lasagna, [try this recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24074/alysias-basic-meat-lasagna/) ‚Äì it's my go to.

Just under three years ago, my family welcomed a new member to our pack: Piper!

Piper as a puppy packed a lot of pep! She was full of energy. While we were fortunate that she never showed much interest in chewing the furniture ‚Äì something young Labradors are known for ‚Äì she had no such compunction about my ankles. There was a period when she was about 10 weeks old where I would only go in the kitchen ‚Äì the part of the house she was limited to at first ‚Äì when wearing knee high rainboots. Protection. üòÖ

My family thinks Piper at any age was adorable, but as a puppy she definitely had her moments. A favourite memory is watching Piper chew a stick with her "best friend"... the yellow Labrador who lives next door and is about five years older than Piper.

These days Piper has slowed down a bit (she loves to sleep on our couch) but when she goes out for a walk (often at Northcote) she will tear around with complete abandon.

We love Piper very much. ü•∞
